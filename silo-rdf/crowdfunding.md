# Crowdfunding

Every RDF DAO is equipped with a crowdfunding proposal found in the 'New Proposal' list on the Proposals page.

The crowdfunding proposal enables any member to configure a public or whitelisted token sale for the DAOs meme tokens. This proposal must be voted on and approved by the members.
