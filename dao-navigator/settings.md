# Settings

Customize the DAOs settings to meet specific requirements. Adjust voting period, grace period, new offering, quorum, minimum retention, and sponsor threshold.

**Voting Period:** determines how long a proposal can be voted on.

**Grace Period:** determines how long a proposal must wait to be executed after the voting period ends. This period gives meme token holders an opportunity to burn their tokens for their share of the treasury if they disagree with the proposal.

**New Offering:** determines the cost for a non-member to submit a proposal to the DAO. This prevents spam proposals.

**Quorum:** determines the percentage of the NFT collection that must vote to approve a proposal.

**Minimum Retention:** TODO

**Sponsor Threshold:** determines the minimum requirement to move a proposal into the voting period.
