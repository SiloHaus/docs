# Overview

Silo Faction is an fractionalization tool designed for NFT owners to sell proportional rights over their high value NFTs, while providing goverance tools to manage the NFTs within shared treasuries.

Once an NFT is fractionalized, it becomes a Faction. Members within a Faction govern the NFT to coordinate around activities and objectives that may be beneficial to the Faction as a whole.
