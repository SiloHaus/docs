# Silo RDF

The Silo RDF (Retroactive DAO Formation) tool enables any existing ERC721 collection to form into an ERC6551 NFT membership DAO.\
\
It works by creating an airdrop for the NFTs within any ERC721 collection to claim both governance power and meme tokens.\
\
The RDF tool summons a Moloch DAO and generates a claim page for holders to claim their airdrops and coordinate around a shared treasury.
