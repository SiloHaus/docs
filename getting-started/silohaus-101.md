# SiloHaus 101

There are two main products offered by SiloHaus.

1. Silo Core: an ERC6551 NFT membership DAO launchpad for creating and selling custom NFT collections and meme tokens.
2. Silo RDF: an airdrop tool to turn any existing ERC721 NFT collection into a DAO with it's own meme token and claim app that deploys ERC6551 TBAs and collects the airdrop.

There are two main elements to all siloDAOs.

1. **Governance Power:** each NFT is provided with equal governance power. There may be options down the line to alter this based on attributes.
2. **Meme Tokens:** each NFT can be allocated an equal amount of the meme token supply, with the remainder distributed to a Safe managed by the DAO.

Both of these elements are directly tied to its DAO's main treasury. What this means is:

1. **Governance Power:** is nontransferable and enables the NFT to vote on how the treasury is managed.
2. **Meme Tokens:** are transferable and enables the holder to burn the tokens in exchange for a proportional share of the treasury. In other words, the meme tokens are deflationary. So if there was 100 ETH in the treasury and you owned 1% of the meme token supply, you could burn the meme tokens to claim 1 ETH.
