# Silo Toolsets

There are three main toolsets offered by Silo Squad.

1. **Silo Core:** an ERC6551 NFT membership DAO launchpad for creating and selling custom NFT collections and meme tokens.
2. **Silo RDF:** an airdrop tool to turn any existing ERC721 NFT collection into a DAO with it's own meme token and claim app that deploys ERC6551 TBAs and collects the airdrop.
3. **Silo Faction:** an NFT fractionalization tool to proportionally govern high value NFTs within a shared treasury.
