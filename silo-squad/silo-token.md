# SILO Token

SILO Token is the main utility token within the Silo ecosystem.

The primary purposes SILO serves are:&#x20;

1. Economic rights in SiloDAO
2. Silo Signals to determine SILO Streams

Economic rights are provided in the form of a burning mechanism known as Rage Quit. When SILO tokens are burned, the holder claims a proportional share of the Silo Squad treasury.

SILO holders can lock their SILO tokens and Signal (vote) on DAOs operating on the Silo platform. The amount of votes determine the rate at which SILO tokens are streamed to the signaled DAOs. Silo Signals is a decentralized curation mechanism to reward the most active and effective DAOs on the platform.
