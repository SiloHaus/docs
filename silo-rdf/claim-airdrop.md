# Claim Airdrop

The claim app displays a holders NFTs that have not been claimed and already claimed.

The claim app also displays all NFTs within the collection and allows anyone to claim for others. This feature enables project teams, community DAOs, and generous whales to subsidize gas fees by claiming for others. When claiming for others, the airdrop is still distributed to the rightful owner of the NFT. So don't worry, no one is able to steal your allocation :).
