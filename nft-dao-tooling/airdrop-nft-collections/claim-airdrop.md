# Claim Airdrop

The claim app is an interface to manage unclaimed and claimed airdrops for the connected wallet's whitelisted NFTs.

From the claim app, he claim app allows anyone to claim for others. This feature enables project teams, community DAOs, and generous whales to subsidize gas fees by claiming for others. When claiming for others, the airdrop is still distributed to the rightful owner of the NFT. So don't worry, no one is able to steal your airdrop :).
