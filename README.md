# Introduction

_These docs are in active development by a squad of contributors known as Silo Squad._

Silo Squad is building an NFT product suite focused on providing unique and engaging experiences that drive deeper purpose for collections and their holders. The mission is to empower holders of both new and existing NFT collections with the tools and patterns to effectively coordinate around shared objectives.

From zero-sum degens to positive sum squads ready for battle.

### siloNFTs

All Silo tools are built on or compatible with the ERC6551 standard, which provides NFTs with the ability to own and store assets within Token Bound Accounts (TBAs). Just as silos are known to store and secure various assets, siloNFTs can be thought of in a similar way. All siloNFTs hold governance tokens permanently bound to their TBAs and can store and manage just about any other asset a normal Ethereum wallet can.

### siloDAOs

Every siloNFT is connected to a siloDAO. Built on the DAOhaus protocol, powered by Moloch contracts, siloDAOs are powerful coordination tools for NFT holders to squad up and align on common goals for a collection as a whole. As a squad, the primary objective is to generate value for their collection by managing and growing a shared treasury to achieve sustainability for continued operations. All siloDAOs come equipped with a meme token generator, crowdfunding tools, and advanced proposal types to interface with any existing protocol or application on their native networks. Ultimately, it's up to each squad to decide on and execute strategies to achieve success.

### Silo Avatars

The members of a siloDAO are actually the siloNFTs themselves, which provides power and abilities to the holder. As such, a siloNFT acts as an identity mechanism, or Avatar, for holders. Within a siloDAO, holders can easily manage their Avatars, delegate their power, and select an identity to operate under.
