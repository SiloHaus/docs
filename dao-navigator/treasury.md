# Treasury

The main treasury of a your DAO is what backs the meme tokens with underlying value. Meme tokens can be burned at any time for a proportional claim of the main treasury. Your DAO's main treasury is a [Safe](https://safe.global/). So anything a Safe can do, your treasury can also do.

Your DAO can also create as many additional Safes that act as side vaults, controlled by your DAO. These side vaults can be used for managing assets that meme token holders shouldn't have access to. For instance, a side vault comes with your DAO by default to manage your DAO's uncirculated meme token supply.
