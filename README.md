# Introduction

_These docs are in active development by a squad of contributors known as Silo Squad._

Silo Squad is building an NFT product suite focused on providing unique and engaging experiences that drive deeper purpose for collections and their holders. The mission is to empower holders of both new and existing NFT collections with the tools and patterns to effectively coordinate around shared objectives.

From zero-sum degens to positive sum squads ready for battle.

### Why Silo?

All Silo tools are built on or compatible with the ERC6551 standard, which provides NFTs with the ability to own and store assets within Token Bound Accounts (TBAs). Just as silos are known to store and secure various assets, siloNFTs can be thought of in a similar way. All siloNFTs hold governance tokens permanently bound to their TBAs and can store and manage just about any other asset a normal Ethereum wallet can.
